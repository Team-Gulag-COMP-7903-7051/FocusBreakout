# Known Issues

* FR Level 2 Circle Platform: Players can’t get hit when they’re standing in the centre of the platform due to the collider “hiding” them from the shooters. This is why they only get shot when jumping onto and off of the platform.
* Exit Portal: Players can get stuck against/beneath the bottom edges of the shape with no way to move/escape.
* Searchlight: Point light child objects sometimes rotate and look at walls and ceilings instead of continuously pointing on the floor while the NavMeshAgent is moving around.
* Level 3 - Key Room bug: Player can glitch through to the hidden room in Level 3.
* Texture Bug: Texture bug found in Level 2 in Area 4-1 where the door automatically opens just past the pushable cover blocks.
* Platform + Player bug: When a Player is located under a moving platform and collides with it between the floor and the platform, the Player gets stuck inside the moving platform and is unable to move at all.
